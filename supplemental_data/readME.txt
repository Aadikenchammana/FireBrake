Explanation of the images:
1) DQNagentcomp - shows relative performance of the different reward functions with DQN
2) PPOagentcomp - shows relative performance of the different reward functions with PPO
3) DQNvPPOcomp - shows relative performance of the PPO and DQN with RDist
4) simulator_comparison_images - shows the fire spreads as simulated by SimFire and FireBrake compared to the actual from BurnMD
5) SLINK_fire_example - shows the movement of the agent while blocking the SLINK fire
6) slink_fire_spread_vis - compares the spread of the SLINK fire with FireBrake vs the actual spread
7) SLINK_prob_example - shows the burn risk channel of the agent while mitigating the slink fire
